					<h1 id="slide3Title" style="color:#EF0107;">Academic Anxiety</h1>
					<h4 id="slide3Headline" style="color:white;">Research has proven that stress has become part of a student's academic life due to the various internal and external expectations placed upon our shoulders (Reddy K.J, 2020)</h4>
					<ul id="slide3List">
						<li>I get uncomfortable with large tasks assigned.</li>
						<li>Seeking straight A's as a priority and viewing B's as failing, due to GPA requirements for transfer.</li>
						<li>Feeling down if unable to meet my instructor's expectations</li>
						<li>Constantly doubting my abilities as a student if failing to get a challenging assignment right the first time</li>

					<h1 id="slide3Title" style="color:#EF0107;">Academic Anxiety (Continued)</h1>
					<h4 id="slide3Headline" style="color:white;">Students often report stress-related symptoms that may range from mild anxiety to sleep and eating disorders, as well as resulting in reduced performance, inability to concentrate, hostility, depression, and other debilitating effects (Stewart et al., 2006).</h4>
					<ul id="slide3List">
						<li>I lose lots of sleep over stress and worrying about my grades.</li>
						<li>Constantly having anxiety over what might happen in the future.</li>
						<li>Feeling isolated and sometimes sad about not seeing friends to concentrate on academics.</li>
						<li>Taken over by exhausting due to my high standards in academics.</li>

					<h1 id="slide3Title" style="color:#EF0107;">Fear of Failure</h1>
					<h4 id="slide3Headline" style="color:white;">In 2013, Bartels and Ryan found that 37.5% of college students have the desire to reach out to counselors to help with their fear of failure in life. (Bartel and Ryan 2013)</h4>
					<ul id="slide3List">
						<li>Worrying that if I fail a class or exam my future is ruined and there's no chance of recovering</li>
						<li>Scared to fall behind in mathematics and constantly stressed about failing it</li>
						<li>Attempting to appear perfect 24/7 to not get rejected by admissions for transfer </li>
						<li>Contantly having my guard up in courses that I have A's in since I contantly worry about losing them</li>

					<h1 id="slide3Title" style="color:#EF0107;">Fear of Failure (Continued)</h1>
					<h4 id="slide3Headline" style="color:white;">Research claims, individuals who fear failure tend to suffer feelings of shame and a heightened sense of failure compared to those who do not fear failure as strongly. (Jacob M Christian, 2004)</h4>
					<ul id="slide3List">
						<li>Feeling like if I fail then I repeated my previous mistakes in high school when I held a 1.8 GPA due to personal reasons.</li>
						<li>Always striving to not look like a lazy student with my instructors since I was looked down in that manner in high school.</li>
						<li>Having the sense of not being able to conquer my past if I still can't perform well academically.</li>
						<li>Contantly having my guard up in courses that I have A's in since I contantly worry about presenting myself as less of a student.</li>

					<h1 id="slide3Title" style="color:#EF0107;">Fear of Rejection</h1>
					<h4 id="slide3Headline" style="color:white;">Research suggests, the aforementioned college students satisfy the desire by their actions, perhaps needing to feel wanted even if it is only for one night. (Jacob M Christian, 2004)</h4>
					<ul id="slide3List">
						<li></li>
						<li>Feeling like if my work cannot impress my instructor then it is not my best work.</li>
						<li>If my work is not above and beyond in any course then I am not improving as a student</li>
						<li>Feeling down if I do not have the time to go the extra mile with a class due to other courses</li>
						<li>Contantly worrying about letting my peers down in a group project if I don't put in more than 100%.</li>

				<h1 id="slide3Title" style="color:#EF0107;">Coping Strageties</h1>
					<h4 id="slide3Headline" style="color:white;">the two proactive strategies, namely the task-oriented and emotion-oriented approaches, are associated with better adjustment, as reflected in higher self-rated coping effectiveness and less depression (Causey, & Dubow, 1993).</h4>
					<ul id="slide3List">
						<li>I lean more to the task-oriented since I want to constantly eliminate the problem to relive my stress.</li>
						<li>However, when I lean to the emotional I always seek guidance or company from my friends.</li>
						<li>Sometimes if I am too stressed and exhausted I won't work ahead and put the assignment off for a better time when I am rested.</li>
						<li>My self-related coping effect would have to be going out and getting some fresh to take deep breathes to remind myself everything will work out.</li>
